      title: What we do
      details: Our core mechanism, the Distributed Renewable Energy Certificate (D-REC), is an innovative market instrument designed to issue Environmental Attribute Certificates (EACs) from small-scale DRE resources. These D-RECs represent a tangible commitment not only to environmental sustainability but also to energy access with a correlation to socio-economic upliftment in underserved communities.

      title: Our impact
      details: The D-REC Organization is more than just a facilitator of RECs. Through D-RECs, we deepen the corporate climate action to enable small-scale DRE projects to become economically viable and environmentally impactful. Our work not only contributes to meeting global sustainability targets but also ensures that the benefits of renewable energy reach those who need it most.
